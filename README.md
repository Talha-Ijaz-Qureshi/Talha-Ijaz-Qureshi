## Hi there.

I'm tal and I'm stubbornly pedantic and persistent to my aspirations. I am an instigator, driven by ambitious goals to leave rippling tides travelling far into the radii. My aspects of engrossment and focuses are several and rather wild, from well-being to war, mechanical engineering of computers to warfare and from coding to cyberwarfare.
